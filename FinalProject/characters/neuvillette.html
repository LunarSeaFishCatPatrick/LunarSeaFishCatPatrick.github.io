          Neuvillette is a playable Pneuma-aligned Hydro character in Genshin
          Impact. Neuvillette is the Iudex of Fontaine, and the leader of the
          Marechaussee Phantom. While Neuvillette upholds the rules of the court
          with utmost reverence, he is quite aloof when dealing with human
          emotions and often distances himself from the public eye. Despite his
          human appearance, he is actually the Hydro Dragon and one of the Seven
          Sovereigns. However, he did not obtain full dragonhood until the
          events of Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty
          when the Hydro Archon Focalors returned the powers stolen by the
          Heavenly Principles from the Sovereigns back to him.

          style="display: none">
          In accordance to his role as the Chief Justice, Neuvillette takes the
          court and trials very seriously, handing out verdicts with
          impartiality. He is notably perceptive, being able to hear Paimon's
          whispers and is able to deduce the additional details from the
          evidence provided to him during a trial. He utilizes the Oratrice
          Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale to make the final decision, honoring its
          request regardless of his own feelings on the matter as per protocol.
          Due to his position and ties to the Hydro Archon, he is popular among
          Fontaine's people as a symbol of justice and honor. As a member of the
          Seven Sovereigns, Neuvillette is unfamiliar with human customs and
          feelings, using the court to help him process and understand them. He
          rarely spends his time out in public, as he does not enjoy unwanted
          attention, and in the few times he speaks to humans, he appears to be
          aloof, though honest in his words. However, when interacting with
          Melusines, he is extremely friendly, seen as the ideal father by them;
          likewise, he is fiercely protective of them, considering them the
          pride of Fontaine and investigating matters himself should he hear of
          a Melusine being bullied or threatened. This stems from his failure to
          protect his friend and subordinate, Carole, when she was driven to
          death due to Fontainian's prejudice, and Neuvillette being forced to
          sentence his other friend, Vautrin, for carrying out a revenge killing
          for Carole, he had since resolved to prevent such tragedy from
          happening ever again. When he was initially reincarnated, Neuvillette
          was left with many questions about himself, leading to him accepting a
          position as the Iudex. His time overseeing trials led him to
          experience a plethora of human experiences and emotions, which was
          secretly prepared by Focalors in the hopes that his newfound
          perception would save the people of Fontaine from a looming prophecy
          that would exterminate them. Upon learning the full extent of
          Focalors' deception, he admitted that she was devious and was both
          saddened and shocked by her self-sacrifice. Indeed, having seen
          humanity positively, Neuvillette used his fully restored powers to
          save the people and left aside fragments of his power in the form of
          Visions for those worthy of them. Neuvillette opposes the Heavenly
          Principles, and by extension The Seven, as they usurped the authority
          of the Dragons that once ruled Teyvat. This appears to be more of a
          professional standpoint than a personal matter, as he expresses
          surprise at the current status of some Archons, like Barbatos, while
          respecting Lesser Lord Kusanali for her duties. Neuvillette enjoys
          water and is an avid taster, being able to discern the properties of
          where the water came from and how it's prepared; as a result, this
          also extends to him liking food with plenty of sauce. He does not like
          deep fried food and grilled food with no sauce, especially taking
          great offence to Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cakes.
