          Emilie is a playable Pneuma-aligned Dendro character in Genshin
          Impact. She is a renowned perfume designer in Fontaine. According to
          Calcagni, Emilie is self-employed, and the fashionable ladies of
          Fontaine highly seek out her products.[4] She also works closely with
          detective forces and law enforcement as a "forensic cleanser" in the
          background, which allows her to give additional information that most
          people might miss at the cost of forcing her to become more familiar
          with death than she would like.

        <p class="description" id="EmilieDescription" style="display: none">
          There is much that may be said when discussing a bottle of perfume. We
          might speak of its fragrance: How it first bewitches with its top
          notes, before gradually melding with its wearer, and finally taking a
          subdued bow amidst the lingering aroma. We could speak of the concept
          underlying its design: Is it meant to enliven the spirit, or to lend
          an aura of alluring mystique? We might even debate the most
          appropriate occasion for its use: Would one be willing to attend a
          social ball clad in this aroma, or would it be better suited to
          suffusing the atmosphere of a private date? Emilie finds these matters
          to be most worthy of discussion, as they are intimately related to how
          one selects a perfume. Compared to such considerations, the precise
          identity of the perfumer who prepared the scent is not a factor that
          needs to be contemplated when making one's choice. Alas, neither
          customers' views nor popular trends are easily shifted. A herd
          mentality that craves security often leads people to prefer purchasing
          from well-known brands or designers, for one rarely goes wrong that
          way. Fame, therefore, is a double-edged sword. The more famous one is,
          the greater the odds of receiving negative feedback, and many are
          exhausted by treading upon such thin ice. But Emilie, famous though
          she is within Fontaine's perfume industry, seems untroubled by such.
          Her products are free-form, spontaneous â€” indeed, she worries not at
          all about designing perfume, for her true profession lies elsewhere.
