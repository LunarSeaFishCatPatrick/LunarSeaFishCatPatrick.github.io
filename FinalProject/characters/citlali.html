         Citlali is a playable Cryo character in Genshin Impact.
Known as "Granny Itztli" among her fellow Masters of the Night-Wind, she is a well-known and powerful shaman of the tribe who tends to live in seclusion. Although easy to anger and very self-indulgent, she harbors a more self-conscious side to her personality. She became a great shaman even without having received an Ancient Name, though later she was told in vision by an ancestor that she would receive the Ancient Name Ukumbuko.

         "Shamans" are practitioners of a mysterious craft who originate from the Masters of the Night-Wind. With many mystical abilities at their disposal, they are wise and powerful figures. In the eyes of the people of Natlan, whether one seeks medicine or wishes to decipher a cryptic prophecy, visiting a shaman is always the right choice. They can be both doctors and prophets, playing indispensable roles both in everyday life and in matters of far greater import. In short, theirs is a highly respected profession.

Yet above the many shamans, there are "great shamans" in a league of their own. They say it is a title that only those who reach the very pinnacle of their mystical arts may earn — and indeed, throughout the entire history of Natlan, they have been few and far between. Their deeds shine forth like the brightest stars in the night sky, adding a touch of legend to the already unfathomable shamanistic mystique.

Citlali is one such great shaman, and the only one in Natlan today.

Yet contrary to what most might expect, you will not find her dealing with everyday matters, nor with major affairs, rarely even participating in events as significant as tribal ceremonies. For outsiders who seek the great shaman's assistance, navigating the many obstacles in their way may prove a greater challenge than traversing the many chasms of Natlan itself.

"Looking for Granny Itztli? Best not disturb her! If you really must go, go prepared — and just so we're on the same page, don't go dragging me into it..." Thus would most members of the Masters of the Night Wind respond, as if Citlali were some formidable fiend, a monster of great menace and untold might.

"The great shaman... Mwahaha, she's your only option, isn't she? Pfff, the Almighty Dragonlord doesn't have time for puny punks like you. But since you asked so nicely, I'll let you use my name when you knock. That way, she's bound to take your request seriously." A certain oddball entity and self-styled Dragonlord might respond as such, as if Citlali were some easily dealt with triviality.

"Need Granny's help? You're looking for the right person if so — she knows everything about everything! Do you have her address? Actually, let me take you there myself! Oh, just so you know, when we get there, you'll have to keep knocking non-stop. Granny's kinda shy, so you have to be proactive, alright?" This is the kind of response you'd receive from a certain top-ranking guide from the People of the Springs, as if Citlali were no more than a bashful young girl.

"Seeking help from Citlali? A wise choice indeed. Her assistance has been instrumental in the success of many of Natlan's most important affairs. I'm confident she'll know how to resolve your troubles too." That great leader, the keeper of the Sacred Flame herself, might say this, as if Citlali were the very epitome of a responsible and approachable elder.

Ultimately, after much inquiry, those seeking her aid often end up feeling even more confused than when they first set out, left with no other choice but to give up their petition as a lost cause.
