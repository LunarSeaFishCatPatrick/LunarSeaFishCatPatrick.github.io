          The Raiden Shogun (Japanese: 雷電将軍 Raiden Shougun) is a playable
          Electro character in Genshin Impact. The Raiden Shogun is comprised of
          two beings in one body: Ei, the current Electro Archon of Inazuma; and
          the Shogun, the puppet created by Ei to act as the ruler of Inazuma in
          her stead.
        </p>
        <p class="description" id="RaidenDescription" style="display: none">
          The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be
          eternity — a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of
          what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the
          people of Inazuma. The Raiden Shogun exists in two forms — Ei, her
          true identity, and the Shogun, a puppet created by Ei to oversee
          Inazuma in her stead while she meditates in the Plane of Euthymia.
          This puppet follows a set of directives programmed into her, which are
          extremely difficult to modify. The Shogun is cold and stern in
          personality, even callous at times; she is limited in emotional
          expression, has no likes and dislikes, and has no need for recreation.
          In none of her voice lines does she ever use contractions (eg. "it's",
          "can't"). The Shogun thinks of herself as Ei's assistant and carries
          out her creator's exact will, unable to act on her own volition. If
          her usual functions are disabled, the Shogun becomes ineffectual. Due
          to limited protocols as a result of Ei's initial indifference towards
          anything other than "eternity", the puppet is able to be manipulated
          by external influences. For example, the Kujou Clan and Fatui
          persuaded her into initiating and maintaining the Vision Hunt Decree.
          While Ei has a more stern demeanor than the average person, she is
          notably more emotive and sociable than the Shogun. Unlike the Shogun,
          Ei has preferences, such as a love for sweets and passion of martial
          arts. Due to her dedication to eternity, Ei maintains a wary attitude
          on the idea of change. However, she demonstrates curiosity rather than
          disdain towards new affairs, such as the appearance of the Traveler
          and the customs of the modern world. Due to having lost many of her
          loved ones over the centuries, Ei is driven by a fear of further loss,
          wanting to preserve Inazuma. To this end, she previously sealed
          herself in the Plane of Euthymia to keep herself from the effects of
          erosion. She created the puppet Shogun to ensure immunity from the
          decay of her physical body. While in the Plane of Euthymia, Ei was
          indifferent to anything that did not affect her pursuit of eternity
          and had a low opinion of human ambition due to it resulting in loss
          and suffering and therefore, making it incompatible with eternity.
          While in the Plane of Euthymia, she was not unmoved by loneliness, as
          Ei is shown enjoying Yae Miko and the Traveler's company. In spite of
          her flawed actions, Ei is devoted to Inazuma, simply longing to
          protect it and her people. After she is convinced that her actions
          were destructive, Ei shows remorse and is willing to change her
          perspective regarding eternity to become a better ruler. She also
          gained a newfound respect for the idea of human ambition and its
          achievements.
