          Clorinde is a playable Ousia-aligned Electro character in Genshin
          Impact. She is the strongest Champion Duelist in Fontaine and once
          served as Furina's bodyguard.

        <p class="description" id="ClorindeDescription" style="display: none">
          Disputes are a Mora a dozen in Fontaine, day in and day out. A
          confectioner might accuse another of stealing their recipe — and not
          only that, but replacing Bulle Fruit peel with Mint, thus bringing
          disgrace not only upon themselves, but upon the very dessert itself!
          Or a playwright might accuse a fanatical reader of imitating their
          style and taking up a pen name too close to their own, to the point
          that even the newspapers could not distinguish the genuine article. A
          merchant might accuse a colleague of targeted, malicious, cutthroat
          competition, of not only constantly adjusting their prices, but of
          intentionally setting up shop directly opposite them... Almost
          everyone claims to be wholly in the right, appealing incessantly for
          the support of passersby in the hope of swaying the crowd and winning
          their case in the court of public opinion. Most of the time, such
          disputes are settled with relative ease, either by Gardes or by
          Gestionnaires rushing onto the scene. But there will always be a
          minority of claimants who, acting with ulterior intentions, will
          obstinately press for court proceedings just to get their name out
          there. "I'll see you in court!" comes the challenge. When things reach
          this stage, any hope that the voice of reason might prevail starts to
          buckle under the unstoppable force of emotion, neither side willing to
          give an inch as they begin to square off for a legal showdown. Until,
          that is, an exasperated Gestionnaire standing by — long since having
          given up any hope of successful mediation — interjects in a tone of
          despair: "Alright, I respect your right to take this to the courts.
          But before you do, you must make the following preparations..."
          "...Once judgment is pronounced, if you believe the verdict to be
          unjust, you may propose that the matter be settled by a duel." "To my
          knowledge, the most recently rostered Champion Duelist is Miss
          Clorinde..." As soon as the name of Clorinde is mentioned, all
          bickering comes to an abrupt halt. For all are well-acquainted with
          the name of this undefeated Champion Duelist. Beneath her blade, all
          despicable deeds that aim to capitalize on mere fortune under the
          guise of decency will show their true colors — and she has never once
          known defeat in a duel. "...Ahem. Oh, uh... I suppose there's no need
          to go that far, is there?" Thus are such marketplace altercations,
          undercut by ulteriority, temporarily dissipated. Watching the two
          self-seeking merchants leave the scene with their tails between their
          legs, the Gestionnaire lets out a knowing laugh, then gives the
          younger, still uncomprehending colleague beside them a pat on the arm,
          and says: "You see, the sword is mightier than the pen, after all."
