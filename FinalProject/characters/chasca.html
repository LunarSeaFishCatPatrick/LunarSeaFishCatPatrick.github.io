          Chasca is a playable Anemo character in Genshin Impact.

The most infamous Peacemaker of the Flower-Feather Clan and no stranger to the Night Warden Wars, Chasca bears the Ancient Name of VK ("VK," Vuka). She is familiar with conflicts — at times struggling with many of her own internal ones — yet despite how many would view her, she is always able to stand above them.

        <p class="description" id="chascaDescription" style="display: none">
         "...There's no hope for the child... You know I can't accept that either! But, please... just give up."

This was the first "conflict" that Chasca experienced in her life.

"...Just what's wrong with this kid? Was she raised by a Qucusaurus or something? No wonder she's so wild..."

This was one of the countless "conflicts" that Chasca faced after returning to the Flower-Feather Clan.

Though her childhood memories were already blurry, Chasca still remembered the emotions stirring beneath those words: disappointment, pain, bitterness, and frustration... People were caught in a web of emotions, forever entangled in "conflict."

But "conflicts" can eventually be resolved. All it takes is a turning point.

"...Kraa?" A Qucusaurus, soaring high up in the sky, just so happened to catch sight of the helpless "child" crying piteously for food down below.

"At least give me a heads-up next time!" A young girl, after practically having searched the length and breadth of the mountains, puffed with anger after finding her runaway "sister."

...Perhaps many "conflicts" weren't as deeply rooted, or as difficult to "transcend," as people imagined?

Gear packed and bullets loaded, Chasca — who was now a fully-fledged Peacemaker — stepped through the door to embrace the morning breeze.

"This time... it's my turn to resolve some conflicts." Lowering the brim of her hat, she smiled to herself.
