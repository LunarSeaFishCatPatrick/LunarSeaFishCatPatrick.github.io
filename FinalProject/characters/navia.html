          Navia Caspar is a playable Ousia-aligned Geo character in Genshin
          Impact. She is the optimistic president of the Spina di Rosula, a
          mantle previously held by her late father Callas. Her enthusiastic and
          tenacious spirit allow her to push on with helping the people of
          Fontaine in spite of the various losses in her life.
        </p>
        <p class="description" id="NaviaDescription" style="display: none">
          As the head of the Spina di Rosula, Navia is devoted to helping people
          of Fontaine, being likened as a "big sister" who checks in on
          everyone. She has a sharp mind and knack for investigating, being able
          to analyze events from different angles and find answers that other
          parties may miss.[2] Due to the struggles Navia had while growing up,
          she sometimes struggles to comprehend her own existence and wonders if
          she did anything meaningful. Despite having lost many loved ones
          throughout the years, particularly her parents Callas and Clementine,
          along with her trusted subordinates Melus and Silver, Navia still
          pushes on for a brighter future, not wanting their sacrifices to be in
          vain. She had a good relationship with Clorinde in her youth, but
          following Clorinde killing her father in a duel, their relationship
          has been strained as she finds it hard to forgive her even after
          understanding his sacrifice. However, after solving the "young women
          disappearance case" with the Traveler and Paimon, Navia and Clorinde
          have started to talk and meet up with each other again to reconcile
          their relationship. Outside of investigating, Navia enjoys baking,
          particularly macarons.
