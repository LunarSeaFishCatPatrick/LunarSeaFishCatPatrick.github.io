          Venti is a playable Anemo character in Genshin Impact. He is a
          free-spirited, wine-loving bard of Mondstadt, belying his identity as
          Barbatos, the Anemo Archon.
        </p>
        <p class="description" id="ventiDescription" style="display: none">
          Around 2,600 years ago, the Archon War had yet to end, and the world
          had yet to fall under the dominion of The Seven. In those days, the
          city called "Mondstadt" was surrounded on all sides by gales
          impenetrable even to the birds of the air. The wind's ceaseless
          howling ground the soil and the rock of that city into smooth, flowing
          dust. The Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was Decarabian, God
          of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before
          him in the unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought
          this good. In those days, Venti was but a single thread of the
          thousand winds that roared through the northern lands. He who would in
          latter days be known as "Barbatos" was but a tiny elemental spirit,
          without a shred of divine dignity, a breeze that brought subtle
          changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope. In Mondstadt of old,
          Venti met a young boy. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed
          to write the greatest poem of all. "I do so wish to see the birds in
          flight." So said the boy who had never seen the blue sky, eagles, or
          the green grass, his voice almost utterly drowned by the wind.
          "Friend, will you not come along?" The elemental being Venti obtained
          the feather of an eagle for the lad living in that storm-shrouded
          city, who had never seen a bird in his life. Then, war broke out in
          Mondstadt, in the name of freedom. With the feather tucked away in his
          breast pocket, Venti watched the fall of the eccentric ruler amid the
          wrack and ruin of revolt together with his friend. The ruler had
          believed that he had given his subjects a city free from the bitter
          cold, and to the end, he believed that they had loved him as he loved
          them. Yet, despite the victory, Venti was never able to give that
          feather to the lad, for that lad had fallen in the battle for the sake
          of song, sky, and birds, and for the people who, like him, had dwelled
          within the storm-wall. With the crumbling of an ancient seat of
          divinity, a new god was born. The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power
          flowing at his fingertips. His first use of this power was to
          reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad. For only if he
          wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved.
          Plucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the
          mountains with a divine wind. He bade Mondstadt become a city of
          freedom, a nation without a king. In future, he believed, it would
          become a better, more romantic city. "Surely, he too would have wanted
          to live in such a place." Thus, a new age began for Mondstadt.
