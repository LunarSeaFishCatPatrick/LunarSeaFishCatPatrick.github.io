          Ganyu (Chinese: 甘雨 Gānyǔ) is a playable Cryo character in Genshin
          Impact. She is a half-qilin adeptus under contract with the Geo Archon
          Morax and serves as the general secretary of the Liyue Qixing. Due to
          her adeptal background, she finds herself struggling to feel she fits
          into the human world.
        </p>
        <p class="description" id="GanyuDescription" style="display: none">
          For the Liyue Qixing of the lofty Yujing Terrace, Ganyu is not merely
          a companion to serve them, but is instead coordinator of the web of
          information that moves across Liyue Harbor, and the architect of
          administrative efficiency. Complex meeting minutes, disorderly report
          data... Every day piles of documents flow by like water, each one
          personally compiled by her into clear and concise words in order to
          assist the Qixing's every decision and negotiation as they flow
          through various organizational departments. In the eons that have gone
          by, the Qixing have changed with each succession of their posts, while
          only Ganyu has lived to see the flourishing of Liyue Harbor from
          beginning to the modern day. The human blood that runs through her
          veins makes her reluctant to leave the splendor of the city lights,
          while her adeptus side leads her to yearn for the gentle serenity of
          her adeptal homeland. For the half-human, half-adeptus Ganyu, between
          the bustling sea of people and the ethereal clustered peaks, which is
          more fitting to call home?
